# Playola Design
================

This repository is for future designs of the playola iPhone app.

To contribute:
1. create (or open) a new branch with the appropriate version number as the name:
```
git checkout -b 2.9
```
2. Mess around all you want in the playground folder
3. When finished messing around, copy final changes to the other folders.  Each folder should contain the final version of a single app pathway.
4. After each design is finished, create a pull request to merge into master
5. All supporting files (images/fonts/etc) should go in the Resources folder.
