# Playola Design
================

This repository is for future designs of the playola iPhone app.

To contribute:
1. Mess around in master all you want...
2. When finished, copy any changes to the AI files in each folder.
3. If a screenflow has changed, take a new screenshot of the entire flow (cmd-shift-4), name it "screenshot.png", and save it in the appropriate folder.
4. Create a new branch for the changes...then immediately switch back to continue working on the next version.
```
git checkout -b 2.9
git checkout master
```
5. All supporting files (images/fonts/etc) should be saved into the AI file or should contain relative links to the Resources folder.
